# Royer - simple sinewave oscillator

Schematics and some PCBs practice in kicad
with several variations (BJT, MOSFET, IGBT)
of simple sinewave oscillators, initially 
published by:

    George H. Royer
    Electrical Manufacturing
    December 1954

Royer oscillator uses zero-voltage switching
(ZVS) to the LC resonant circuit. Voltage at
LC is sinewave when oscillator is unloaded.
More load will more deform the sinewave.
